# Basic Require Function

This is an example of using the *require* keyword in NodeJS. In the announce.js file I am exporting a function that takes an parameter and logs it with the text, "Announcing: " in front of it. The index.js file then calls this announce function. 

You can run this script like this:

*node index*

And it should output:

*Announcing: Hello from Jimothy!*
