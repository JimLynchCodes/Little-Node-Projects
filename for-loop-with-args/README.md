# For Loop with Args

This is an example of using process.argv to get ahold of any arguments that are passed in when the script is run. This script will take any number of arguments and finds their sum.

You can run this script like this:

*node index [args...]*

For example, running this:

*node index 4 10 2 1 1*

should return: 

The sum is: 18
